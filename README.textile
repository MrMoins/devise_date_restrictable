h1. Devise Date Restrictable

This is a module for "Devise":https://github.com/plataformatec/devise that allows a user account to be restricted by date range.

h2. Installation + Setup

Add the following line to your application’s Gemfile:

<pre><code>gem 'devise_date_restrictable'</code></pre>

And then run @bundle install@.

Next, you will need to generate an ActiveRecord migration and run that migration.

<pre><code>$ rails generate devise_date_restrictable --model MODEL
rake db:migrate</code></pre>

Finally, add @:date_restrictable@ to the devise line of your model, for instance:

<pre><code>devise :database_authenticatable, :registerable, :recoverable, :rememberable, :trackable, :date_restrictable</code></pre>

h2. Usage

This gem adds two @DATE@ fields to your account model: @valid_from@ and @valid_until@. One or both may be specified in order to restrict an account’s ability to log in.
If neither is specified, the user will be able to log in without restriction.

Note that dates are _inclusive_: that is, setting an account to be valid *from* 2017-05-28 means they will be able to log in from midnight on 2017-05-28. Similarly, setting an account to be valid *until* 2017-05-27 means they will be able to log in until 23.59.59 on that date.
At this time, all restrictions are based on server time—no provision has been made, as yet, for different timezones.

h2. To-do

This has been fairly quickly bashed together for use within a project, therefore isn’t perhaps as polished as it might be. At some point, I might get around to implementing some of the following:

* add support for timezones
* add helper methods to the account object to facilitate easier management (eg. @user.set_valid_for(3.years)@, and the like)
* support for better messaging
